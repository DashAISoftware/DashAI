.. note::
   This section includes a brief guide on how to write a user guide for a specific software component.
   Remember to delete it when you move it to production.

To create a good user guide for a component, answer the following questions:

* What does it do? What is it trying to abstract?
* Where in the flow does it live?
    * Add some useful screenshots to guide the user.
    * Explain when the component is created, configured and executed.
    * Mention (and explain if necessary) all the requirements and results of each step.
    * Give a brief summary of the configurations that can be made by the user.
* What are the variants of the component?
* What are the limitations of the component?
