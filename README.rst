DashAI: a graphical toolbox for training, evaluating and deploying state-of-the-art
AI models


Dependencies
============

DashAI requires:

- Python (>= 3.8)
- FastAPI (>= 0.79.0)
- SQLAlchemy (>=1.4.36)
- scikit-learn (>=1.0.2)

Installation
============

You can install DashAI via pip:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install dashai

Then, to initialize the server and the graphical interface, run:

.. code:: bash

    $ dashai

Finally, go to `http://localhost:3000/ <http://localhost:3000/>`_ in your browser to access to the DashAI graphical interface.


Development
===========


To download and run the development version of DashAI, first, download the repository
and switch to the developing branch: :

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/DashAISoftware/DashAI.git
    $ git checkout staging


Frontend
--------

.. warning::

    All commands executed in this section must be run
    from `DashAI/front`. To move there, run:

    .. code::

        $ cd DashAI/front


Prepare the environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. `Install the LTS node version <https://nodejs.org/en>`_.

2. Install `Yarn` package manager following the instructions located on the
   `yarn getting started <https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started>`_ page.

3. Move to `DashAI/front` and Install the project packages
   using yarn:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd DashAI/front
    $ yarn install


Running the frontend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Move to DashAI/front if you are not on that route:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd DashAI/front

Then, launch the front-end development server by running the following command:

.. code:: bash

    $ yarn start

If you want to launch the front-end test server (without launching the backend) with dummy data, run:

.. code:: bash

    $ yarn json-server

Linting and formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project uses as default linter `eslint <https://eslint.org/>`_ with
the `react/recommended`, `standard-with-typescript`` and `prettier`` styles.

To manually run the linter, move to `DashAI/front` and run:

.. code:: bash

    $ yarn eslint src


The project uses `prettier <https://prettier.io/>`_ as default formatter.

To format the code manually, move to `DashAI/front` and execute:

.. code:: bash

    $ yarn prettier --write src


Build the frontend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute from `DashAI/front`:

.. code:: bash

    $ yarn build

Backend
-------


Prepare the environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, set the python enviroment using
`conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_:

.. code: bash

    $ conda create -n dashai python=3.10
    $ conda activate dashai

Then, move to `DashAI/back`

.. code:: bash

    $ cd DashAI/back


Later, install the requirements:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt


Running the Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to run DashAI:

1. By executing DashAI as a module:

.. code:: bash

    $ python -c "import DashAI;DashAI.run()"

2. Or,  installing the default build:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install .
    $ dashai

If you chose the second way, remember to install it each time you make changes.


Execute tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DashAI uses `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`_ to perform the backend
tests.
To execute the backend tests

1. Move to `DashAI/back`

.. code:: bash

    $ cd DashAI/back

2. Run:

.. code:: bash

    $ pytest tests/

.. note::

    The database session is parametrized in every endpoint as
    ``db: Session = Depends(get_db)`` so we can test endpoints on a test database
    without making changes to the main database.


Linting and formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project uses as default backend linter
`ruff <https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff>`_:

To manually run the linter, move to `DashAI/back` and execute:

.. code:: bash

    $ ruff .


The project uses `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ as default formatter.

To manually format the code, move to `DashAI/back` and execute:

.. code:: bash

    $ black .
